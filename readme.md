### Talent Frameworks Marketing ###

To drive discovery of IBM Talent Frameworks, a small marketing widget was created.
The widget fits into a discover-trial-buy experience.
Using the widget, site visitors can search for jobs to determine if Talent Frameworks has the desired content.
A partner can add functionality to progress discovery to whitepapers or similar gated marketing material.

## Usage

Add the Javascript widget to your website in a few lines of code.

```javascript
<script src="./jobs.js"></script>
<script src="./index.js"></script>
```

The sample `index.html` uses [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)/[Bootswatch](http://http://bootswatch.com/) as styling.

You are free to build your own HTML.  Simply ensure that the search textbox has `id='search'` and the location of search results has `id='searchResults'`.
